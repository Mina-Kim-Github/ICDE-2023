# ICDE-2023

This repository contains files of codes I used to prepare presentation at 2023 International Conference on Data Engineering.

The files are moved from their original repositories, in order to be presented to the admission committee members. In addition, datasets are removed because I have no right to share them with the others or open in publicly. Therefore, please understand that the codes will not perform as they should be.

I hope this helps the admission committee to assess my programming skills.
